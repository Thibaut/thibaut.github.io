      <h1>The Positive World Manifesto</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>I dream things that never were; and I say, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we, human beings, are to be better than other animals and prosper, we need
to embrace the truth about our impact on the environment and evolve from our
instinctive sense of self-interest to a sense of responsibility and respect.</p>

<p><strong>A positive world is rich in shared, positive emotions.</strong></p>

<p>It strives to enhance individual and collective well-being in ways that are
environmentally sustainable and socially just.</p>

<p>It measures progress not by GDP but by its ability to convert the planet&rsquo;s
natural resources into long and happy lives, using scores like the
<a href="https://happyplanetindex.org/">Happy Planet Index</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A positive world is sustainable, with zero population growth.</strong></p>

<p>It thrives within the Earth&rsquo;s environmental limits, with zero growth in the
rates of consumption of resources.</p>

<p>It improves instead of destroy, recycles instead of waste, and protects that
which it cannot repair.</p>

<p>It aims to make the sum total of the effects of Humanity on the Natural World
positive and increase over time.</p>

<p><strong>A positive world is an extended family that cares.</strong></p>

<p>It has a respectful, humble society where people live and thrive together — not
against each other.</p>

<p>It makes the empathic and solidary nature of human beings shine throughout
every corner of the Earth.</p>

<p>It resolves conflict with open dialogue, embracing the diversity in thoughts,
backgrounds, and lifestyles.</p>

<p><strong>A positive world doesn&rsquo;t sacrifice its long-term interests for short-term rewards.</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a meritocracy where compassion and concern for the welfare of all beings
prevail against irresponsible greed.</p>

<p>It self-regulates and collaborates on a global level, with integrity, putting
the interest of the community before that of the individual.</p>

<p><strong>A positive world is fair and responsible.</strong></p>

<p>It complies with the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>,
treating all humans and animal beings as such — with dignity.</p>

<p>It strives to offer everyone willing to take a stand with a fair chance at an
extraordinary life, regardless of family background, income, or geographic
location.</p>

<p>It responds to Life by being responsible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present. The
occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise—with the occasion. As
our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disentrall
ourselves, and then we shall save our country.<br>
<small>Abraham Lincoln</small></p>
