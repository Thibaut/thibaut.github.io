      <h1>The Positive Business Manifesto</h1>

<p><strong>A positive business benefits the world without damaging it.</strong></p>

<p>Its code of conduct puts respect and responsibility before the making of
money. Respect toward the beings and the environment. Responsibility toward
the long-term consequences of its actions.</p>

<p><strong>A positive business strives for profits while pursuing a vision that
encompasses sustainable change for the world and a better life for all its
stakeholders.</strong></p>

<p>It has a strict adherence to the view that, for it to gain, those it deals
with should gain as well.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s driven by passion.</p>

<p><strong>A positive business cares.</strong></p>

<p>It strives to create emotional connections between its stakeholders and
eliminate any kind of cynicism.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t put its selfish interests before the well-being of the Earth and
its inhabitants.</p>

<p>It adheres to the view that sustainable development is not only a marketing
strategy but a duty.</p>

<p><strong>A positive business embraces diversity in thoughts, opinions, and
backgrounds.</strong></p>

<p>It acts with integrity, is fair, and shares profits.</p>

<p>Its leaders build for the future and put the long-term interests of the
company ahead of their own.</p>

<p><strong>A positive business makes people happy.</strong></p>

<p>It trusts its employees, allowing them to thrive and develop full lives
outside of the workplace.</p>

<p>From the top comes a positive energy that trickles up and sideways through
the entire organization.</p>

<p><strong>A positive business is willing to sacrifice short-term benefits in order to
protect its culture and prosperity in the long run.</strong></p>

<p>Together with all its employees, a positive business is on a mission to make
the impossible possible â€” to make the world a better place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We become a powerful force when each of us understands how powerful all of
us are and when all of us understand how valuable each of us is.<br>
