title: Business Execution

The idea that business ideas are worthless unless executed and execution is
worth millions has always been at the heart of my business philosophy, but
it's only recently that I gripped the full meaning of the verb *to execute*.

For years I've believed that *to execute* is like *to build*. I focused too
much on the details and lost sight of the essential, that good execution is
about having good judgment â€” making the right decisions.

To build something requires mainly technical skills. The better our skills
are, the better our creations will be. However in the business world, if our
creations aren't something people are willing to pay for, they're worthless.

While technical skills can be acquired rather easily and in a relatively short
period of time, the skill of great judgment takes time and experience to
acquire, which makes it much more valuable. It is, by and large, the
difference between an employee and his manager.

> Doing the right things is more important than doing things right.

This quote (attributed to various sources) says it all: **it's not enough to do
it right, you have to do what's right**.
