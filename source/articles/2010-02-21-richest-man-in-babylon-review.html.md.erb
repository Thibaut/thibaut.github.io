I've just finished reading [The Richest Man in Babylon](https://www.amazon.com/Richest-Man-Babylon-George-Clason/dp/0451205367/)
by George Samuel Clason. It's a short book with life-changing capabilities.

Written in the 1920s, it's packed with parables set in ancient Babylon (the
wealthiest city of the ancient world) more than 6,000 years ago, yet its
lessons and wisdom still apply today. The laws of money are universal and
unchanging.

Through the inspiring stories of ancient craftsmen, merchants, and money
lenders we learn how to repay debts and achieve financial success with nothing
to start with (most of these men and women started as slaves). It explains the
fundamentals of money: how to acquire it, keep it, and grow it.

The principles in this book are simple and one might even find them obvious,
but to be reminded of them in the way George Clason has presented them is of
great value.

It's said the book is "beloved by million"; I certainly liked it and would
recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it yet.
