# The Positive Business Manifesto

**A positive business benefits the world without damaging it.**

Its code of conduct puts respect and responsibility before the making of
money. Respect toward the beings and the environment. Responsibility toward
the long-term consequences of its actions.

**A positive business strives for profits while pursuing a vision that
encompasses sustainable change for the world and a better life for all its
stakeholders.**

It has a strict adherence to the view that, for it to gain, those it deals
with should gain as well.

It's driven by passion.

**A positive business cares.**

It strives to create emotional connections between its stakeholders and
eliminate any kind of cynicism.

It doesn't put its selfish interests before the well-being of the Earth and
its inhabitants.

It adheres to the view that sustainable development is not only a marketing
strategy but a duty.

**A positive business embraces diversity in thoughts, opinions, and
backgrounds.**

It acts with integrity, is fair, and shares profits.

Its leaders build for the future and put the long-term interests of the
company ahead of their own.

**A positive business makes people happy.**

It trusts its employees, allowing them to thrive and develop full lives
outside of the workplace.

From the top comes a positive energy that trickles up and sideways through
the entire organization.

**A positive business is willing to sacrifice short-term benefits in order to
protect its culture and prosperity in the long run.**

Together with all its employees, a positive business is on a mission to make
the impossible possible â€” to make the world a better place.

us are and when all of us understand how valuable each of us is.
