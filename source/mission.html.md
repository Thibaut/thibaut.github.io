# Mission Statement

## Something worth fighting for

Love, Nature, Happiness.

> He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how.  
<small>Friedrich Nietzsche</small>

## Meaning

> What is demanded of man is not to endure the meaninglessness of life, but
rather to bear his incapacity to grasp its unconditional meaningfulness in
rational terms.  
<small>Viktor E. Frankl</small>

## Values

* Responsibility
* Fairness
* Caring
* Passion
* Respect
* Independence
* Curiosity
* Perseverance
* Progress
* Knowledge

> A human being is not one thing among others; things determine each other,
but man is ultimately self-determining. What he becomes—withing the limits of
endowment and environment—he has made out of himself.  
<small>Viktor E. Frankl</small>

## Goals

* Love. Build a family.
* Travel. Play. Live.
* Never stop creating, learning, observing, understanding.
* Build or work for a [positive organization](/positive-business.html).
* Drive my own Ferrari on a race track (offset double the carbon emissions).
* Live in a zero-energy building.
* Make a positive contribution toward the protection of the environment.
* Speak or perform for an audience.
* Be a mentor to someone.
* Never give up and stay true to my values.

> The same wind blows on us all. The difference in arrival is not in the
> blowing of the wind, but the setting of the sail.  
> <small>Jim Rohn</small>

## Invictus

> Out of the night that covers me,  
> Black as the pit from pole to pole,  
> I thank whatever gods may be  
> For my unconquerable soul.
>
> In the fell clutch of circumstance  
> I have not winced nor cried aloud.  
> Under the bludgeonings of chance  
> My head is bloody, but unbowed.
>
> Beyond this place of wrath and tears  
> Looms but the Horror of the shade,  
> And yet the menace of the years  
> Finds and shall find me unafraid.
>
> It matters not how strait the gate,  
> How charged with punishments the scroll,  
> I am the master of my fate:  
> I am the captain of my soul.
>
> <small>William Earnest Henley, 1875</small>
