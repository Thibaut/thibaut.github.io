    <h1>Choose Responsibly</h1>
    <p>Certainly one of our greatest powers is our ability to determine ourselves and
decide of our attitude at any given moment. Though this freedom finds its
limits in the conditions in which we live in, we are always free to take a
stand and even in the direst situations, to decide what to make of our
existence.</p>

<p>How we use this freedom defines who we are and, as with every great power,
<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Stan_Lee">there must also come great responsibility</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freedom is only part of the story and half the truth. Freedom is but the
negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is
responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere
arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness.
<small>Viktor E. Frankl</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freedom allows for both good and evil. While our society tries to enforce that
nobody falls to the dark side, it remains our responsibility to choose between
the many different shades of good.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this new age of science and technology has expanded our choice
and revealed to us the full scope of our freedom. While our ancestors could
rely on traditions, such as religions, to tell them what they ought to do, we
now stand fully aware of the infinite different ways in which we could live
our lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it that human beings, surely the most intelligent life form on earth,
do not strive to achieve their maximum potential? The reason is simple: we
have been given the freedom of choice.
<small>Jim Rohn</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In facing a choice, multiplying the options doesn&rsquo;t always lead to a better
outcome, for it then requires that we make up our mind and be strong enough to
act. In particular, the former requires a certain level of knowledge that
grows exponentially with the number of options.</p>

<p>In the case of life, some options are attractive at first sight but
disappointing in reality, while others take great courage to choose but offer
immense rewards in the end. Most important, some are unknown to us until we
acquire the knowledge that will reveal them to us.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I find acquiring knowledge to be one of the most important
pastimes, because it broadens my view and understanding of the world, thus
increasing my opportunities and improving my judgment.</p>

<p>We all have a remarkable potential and we must decide what to make of it.
While some might be satisfied with less than others, many strive for more.
Whatever we decide, we should not forget that everything is possible, so long
as we believe, and put in the mental effort to become what we ought to be.</p>

<p><strong>It is our responsibility to choose what&rsquo;s best for us, our loved ones, and
the world.</strong></p>
