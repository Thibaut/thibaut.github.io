    <h1>Think and Grow Rich</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Original-Classic/dp/1906465592/">Think and Grow Rich</a>
is a book written by Napoleon Hill first published in 1937. The book offers a
comprehensive &ldquo;formula&rdquo; for personal achievement which could mark a turning
point in anyone&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>Hill spent more than two decades interviewing and synthesizing the experience
and insights of over five hundred people who achieved great wealth during
their lifetimes.</p>

<p>Energetic, the book is an easy read filled with practical advice. Although
some passages may feel outdated from a scientific point of view (the world has
since made tremendous progress in the field of cognitive science), the text is
remarkably relevant for our time â€” a time of unprecedented opportunity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Success comes to those who are success conscious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While some worry about origin, education, or amount of capital, Hill&rsquo;s central
idea is that the source of wealth is non-material. Successful men and women
were not born this way, they <em>thought</em> and <em>grew</em> rich.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both poverty and riches are the offspring of thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He describes 13 principles that make for the perfect personal philosophy. In
my opinion, mastering the first two, Desire and Faith, is both essential and
enough, because they will make us do whatever it takes to achieve anything we
want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Success is neither magical or mysterious. Success is the natural consequence
of consistently applying the basic fundamentals.
<small>Jim Rohn</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think and Grow Rich is a list of fundamentals that will change the way you
think and, as an extra, make you rich.</p>
