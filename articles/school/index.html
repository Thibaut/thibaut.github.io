    <h1>School</h1>
    <p>As time goes by I realize the importance of self-education and how valuable it
is to have the passion to learn.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t achieve my full potential in school but feel like if I ever do it in
life, it would be because of the way I &ldquo;self-learned&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have the credentials that major schools offer, but in those
disciplines I&rsquo;m most passionate about — the ones that matter, I have not only
the skills but also the experience.</p>

<p>Students shouldn&rsquo;t wait to be unemployed or &ldquo;bad-employed&rdquo; to start learning
the practical skills and acquiring the experience that can get them the job
they truly want. Real experience beats any credential.</p>

<p>While a diploma tells our employer what we supposedly can do, a business or
professional experience tells him what we&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<p>We all know that rehearsing something is far different from doing it for real.
I believe the marketplace is where this rule is the most strictly applied. The
closer we grow to the marketplace, the faster we can find our way in this
tough environment.</p>

<p>School (or at least some form of education) is essential, but it&rsquo;s not enough.
It provides the foundation, but that&rsquo;s only part of the edifice. The rest is
ours to build the way we want, with our own hands, by our own personal
ideology.</p>

<p>Jim Rohn said, &ldquo;work harder on yourself that you do on anything else.&rdquo; I
believe this is especially true in school because that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;re most
willing to learn — when we have the passion, the dreams, and the energy. For
most of us it only gets harder as we get older.</p>

<p>However, we shouldn&rsquo;t focus only on the technical and practical side of
things. The day I started learning about personal development, or how to
achieve success, wealth, and happiness, was one of the turning points of my
life. There are valuable lessons to learn and fundamentals to master.</p>

<p><strong>If we are to climb the ladder of success, our country may help us take the
first step by providing schools that can get us our first job, but we have to
take all the other ones.</strong></p>
