    <h1>Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Linchpin-Are-Indispensable-Seth-Godin/dp/1591843162/">Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?</a>
is an excellent book by Seth Godin that explains how and why you should become
a linchpin — someone not easily replaced.</p>

<p>In the marketplace, the easier people are to replace the less they need to be
paid and the easier they are to lay off. The industrial revolution has created
a world of factories and factory workers which goes against the creative and
independent nature of human beings.</p>

<p>On the other hand, artists are now rewarded far more than they used to be. The
new age of technology makes it possible for everyone to be both remarkable and
remarked.</p>

<p>Artists are people who give more than they receive, drive change, and make
things happen. They prevent organizations from falling into pieces because
they do their best — more than what they&rsquo;re paid for. They&rsquo;re the ones who
keep the marketplace running.</p>

<p>There is an artist in every one of us but in this factory world we&rsquo;re being
taught to follow the crowd instead of striving for our own, unique path. For
millenniums men have been in charge of their own lives. Nowadays we&rsquo;re being
brainwashed into thinking that the only way for us to succeed is to fit in the
system and do what others think we should be doing.</p>

<p>I especially agree with Seth when he blames our education system for this
brainwashing. Schools are on the front line of our education and yet they
teach us to comply with a set of rules and live only within these limits.
They stigmatize mistakes thus preventing the expression of creativity, an
essential skill of artists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The essential thing measured by school is whether or not you are good at
school.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But creativity, imagination, and the freedom of choice are all part of the
human condition. They&rsquo;re always available for us to use and can&rsquo;t be coerced
into retreat.</p>

<p>Most of the resistance sits in our own mind. Fear is the greatest barrier
against becoming an artist: fear of failure, fear of working without a map,
fear of criticism… They can all be overcome by finding purpose in our lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The linchpin feels the fear, acknowledges it, then proceeds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Seth puts it, &ldquo;every day is a new chance to choose.&rdquo; Becoming a linchpin is
certainly the best choice you could make.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it that human beings, surely the most intelligent life form on earth,
do not strive to achieve their maximum potential? The reason is simple: we
have been given the freedom of choice.
<small>Jim Rohn</small></p>
